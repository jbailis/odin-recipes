    <h2>Maple and brown sugar oatmeal is super easy to make. I was tired of buying the packages, so I decided to experiment and this is it!</h2>
    
    <p>This really satisfied my craving for the “packet” stuff! This is so much better! Can’t wait to have it again! I added a pinch of salt and a tiny splash of vanilla. Definitely a new favorite! Thank you!!!!</p>
